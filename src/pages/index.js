// Gatsby is smart enough to know that if you export out some thing that has this graphql statement this is probably a query that you want to use and pass into whatever component you're exporting out by default.
// we get access to the query as an object called data that is passed as props, so we can deconstruct it in the declaration of the component ({data})
